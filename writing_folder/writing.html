              <p>Nifedipine capsules

                Dick, Tim, and Jason were out shopping for groceries at their local store. As they were walking down the aisles, Dick suddenly felt a sharp, shooting pain in his legs. He tried to ignore it, but the pain only seemed to get worse.
                
                "Hey, are you okay?" Tim asked, noticing that Dick was grimacing in pain.
                
                "Yeah, I'm fine," Dick said through gritted teeth. "Just some muscle spasticity."
                
                Jason, who was pushing the shopping cart, turned to look at Dick. "Do you need to sit down for a bit?"
                
                Dick shook his head. "No, I'll be fine. Let's just finish up and get out of here."
                
                But as they continued shopping, the muscle spasticity became more and more intense. Dick's legs began to twitch and jerk involuntarily, causing him to lose control of his wheelchair. People in the store started to stare and whisper as Dick struggled to keep his balance.
                
                One child, who was standing with his parents nearby, asked loudly, "Mommy, why is that man in a wheelchair?"
                
                The child's parents shushed him and whispered something in his ear, but not quietly enough for Dick and his brothers to not overhear.
                
                "They're saying that I'm a burden and that I should just stay at home," Dick muttered, his face turning red with embarrassment and anger.
                
                Tim and Jason both looked outraged. "That's not true!" Tim exclaimed. "You are not a burden, Dick. You're our brother and we love you no matter what."
                
                Jason nodded in agreement. "And those people have no right to say things like that. They have no idea what you've been through."
                
                As they finished their shopping and headed for the checkout, Dick couldn't help but feel grateful for his brothers' support and love. Despite the ableist comments and stares from strangers, he knew that he could always count on Tim and Jason to have his back.
                
                
                As Dick navigated the crowded aisles of the grocery store, he couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. He had been experiencing muscle spasticity in his legs all morning, and it seemed to be getting worse as the day went on. Despite his best efforts to push through the pain, he knew that it was only a matter of time before his muscles would give out completely.
                
                "Hey, Dick, you okay?" Tim asked, noticing the strained look on his older brother's face.
                
                "Yeah, I'm fine," Dick replied, trying to downplay the severity of his condition. "Just a little muscle spasticity."
                
                "You sure you don't want me to take over for a bit?" Jason offered, his brow furrowed with concern.
                
                "No, I've got it," Dick insisted, determined to keep going.
                
                But as they rounded the corner into the produce section, Dick's muscles suddenly seized up, causing his chair to come to a sudden stop. He let out a pained groan as the spasms wracked his body, causing his brothers to rush to his side.
                
                "Are you okay?" Tim asked, his voice laced with worry.
                
                "Yeah, I'll be fine," Dick gritted out through clenched teeth, trying to push through the pain.
                
                As they tried to help Dick regain control of his muscles, they couldn't help but notice the stares and whispers of the other shoppers. One particularly curious child tugged on their parent's arm, asking why Dick was in a wheelchair. The parents responded with a rude and ableist comment, causing Tim and Jason to exchange a disgusted look.
                
                "Don't worry about them," Tim said, placing a comforting hand on his brother's shoulder. "We've got you covered."
                
                Jason nodded in agreement, his face set in a determined expression. "Yeah, let's just get you home so you can rest."
                
                As they helped Dick back to his chair and finished their shopping, the three brothers knew that they had each other's backs no matter what challenges came their way.
                
                
                
                
                "Hey guys, did you know that there's a theorem that states that the square root of any number can be expressed as an infinite series?" Tim said excitedly as they shopped for groceries.
                
                "Oh boy, here we go," Jason said with a grin, rolling his eyes playfully. "Another one of Tim's math lectures."
                
                "Come on, Jason, this is actually really interesting," Dick chimed in. "What's the theorem called, Tim?"
                
                "It's called the Taylor series," Tim replied, beaming with pride. "I just learned about it in school today, and I've been wanting to share it with you guys."
                
                "Well, we're all ears," Jason said, pretending to be interested. "Go ahead and blow our minds with your mathematical genius."
                
                Tim chuckled at his brother's teasing, but happily continued explaining the theorem. Dick listened attentively, impressed by Tim's knowledge and enthusiasm for math.
                
                As they listened to Tim, Jason's mind was also on the meal they were planning to make. "So, I was thinking we could make a chicken parmesan for dinner," he said. "I found a recipe online that looks amazing. It's got a crispy breaded chicken topped with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. What do you guys think?"
                
                "Sounds delicious," Dick said, his mouth watering at the thought.
                
                "Count me in," Tim added. "I can't wait to dig in."
                
                Suddenly, Dick's legs began to feel tense and involuntary spasms started to wrack his muscles. He winced in pain as his legs jerked and spasmed uncontrollably.
                
                "Hey, are you okay?" Tim asked, noticing the grimace on Dick's face.
                
                "Yeah, it's just my muscles acting up," Dick replied through gritted teeth. "It's called spasticity. It's a common side effect of spinal cord injuries."
                
                Jason reached out to steady Dick's chair as the spasms intensified. "Do you need some help?" he asked.
                
                "I'm okay, I just need to ride it out," Dick replied, trying to maintain his composure.
                
                As they waited for the spasms to subside, they became aware of people staring at them. Dick could overhear a child asking their parents why he was in a wheelchair. The parents replied with an ableist comment, saying that he must have done something wrong in his life to end up in a wheelchair.
                
                Tim's face turned red with anger at the comment, and he was about to speak up when Jason laid a calming hand on his shoulder. "It's not worth it, Tim," he whispered. "We just need to focus on getting Dick home and making sure he's comfortable."
                
                Dick appreciated the support of his brothers, and was grateful that they didn't let the ableist comment get to them. As the spasms finally subsided, he took a deep breath and looked up at his brothers with a smile.
                
                "Thanks, guys. I'm good now. Let's finish shopping and get home to start cooking that delicious meal you promised me, Jason."
