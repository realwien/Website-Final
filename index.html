                        Wi En (she/her) is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Communication and New Media at the National University of Singapore and recently obtained her Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences (Hons) from the same university.  
                        She is interested in uncovering the embodied experiences of media technology usage and how this affects the way people communicate and engage in their daily activities. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Tracing how the media environment in Singapore transformed over the years, her Bachelor's thesis attempted to capture some of the interactions between elderlies, their social environment, and technology to understand how elderlies in Singapore navigated a changing digital information landscape. 
                        Her current research focuses on examining gender representations in the metaverse and the role of virtual fashion in the construction and deconstruction of gender and gendered differences. 
                        <br> <br>
                        In her spare time, she enjoys reading science fiction novels, testing the limits of her spice tolerance and dreaming of her next travel destination.
