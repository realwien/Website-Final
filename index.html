                        She is interested in uncovering the embodied experiences of media technology usage and how this affects the way people communicate and engage in their daily activities.

                        Tracing how the media environment in Singapore transformed over the years, her Bachelor's thesis attempted to capture some of the interactions between elderlies, their social environment, and technology to understand how elderlies in Singapore navigated a changing digital information landscape. 
                        Her current research focuses on examining gender representations in the metaverse and the role of virtual fashion in the construction and deconstruction of gender and gendered differences. 
                        <br> <br>
                        In her spare time, she enjoys reading science fiction novels, testing the limits of her spice tolerance and dreaming of her next travel destination.

                        <p>
                            This paper was co-authored with my friend as part of our graduate coursework, and is a preliminary inquiry into the unique interplay between nationalism and cultural perception in Singapore.
                            <br> We argue that those who align more strongly with Singapore’s nationalistic attitudes are less inclined to develop attitudes of cultural cringe, viewing local cultural expressions not as subpar Western replicas but as emblems of Singapore’s national prowess.
